Core Java Concepts

1. OOP Principles
	# Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
	# Interface vs Abstract class

Inheritance
	* Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
	* It allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (parent/superclass).

	This helps in:
		- Code reusability (no need to rewrite existing logic)
		- Extensibility (add or override behavior)
		- Maintainability (common behavior in one place)

	Syntax:
	class Parent {
    	// parent class members
	}

	class Child extends Parent {
	    // child class members
	}

2. Data Types & Variables
	# Primitive vs Non-Primitive
	# Wrapper classes, type casting

3. Control Flow & Loops

4. Collections Framework
	# List, Set, Map (ArrayList vs LinkedList, HashSet vs TreeSet, HashMap vs LinkedHashMap vs TreeMap)
	# Iterators, Comparator vs Comparable

5. Exception Handling
	# Checked vs Unchecked
	# try-catch-finally, throw vs throws

6. Multithreading & Concurrency
	# Thread class, Runnable, ExecutorService
	# synchronized, volatile, wait/notify
	# Race condition, deadlock

7. Java 8+ Features
	# Lambda expressions
	# Streams API
	# Functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer)
	# Optional, Method References
