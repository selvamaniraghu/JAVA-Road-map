Polymorphism

	- Polymorphism means “many forms.” In Java, polymorphism allows the same method to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it.
	It helps achieve: Flexibility, Code reusability, Runtime dynamic behavior

	| Type                      | What it is                           | Achieved by        | When decided |
	| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
	| Compile-time Polymorphism | Method call resolved at compile-time | Method Overloading | Compile-time |
	| Runtime Polymorphism      | Method call resolved at runtime      | Method Overriding  | Runtime      |

	1. Compile-time Polymorphism

	 - Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameter list

	 class Calculator {
	    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
	    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
	}

	Why used?
	To increase method readability and usability.

	2. Runtime Polymorphism

	✔️ Method Overriding: Subclass provides specific implementation of a parent method
	✔️ Uses dynamic method dispatch

	class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal makes a sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog(); // Parent reference → Child object
        obj.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
